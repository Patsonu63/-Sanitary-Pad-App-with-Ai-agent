# Sanitary-Pad-App-with-Ai-agent
Okay, creating a full mobile app involves many steps (UI design, robust data storage, testing, platform-specific configurations, etc.). However, I can provide you with a conceptual structure and example code snippets using Flutter (a popular cross-platform framework using the Dart language) to illustrate the core functionalities of a basic sanitary pad tracking app.

This example will focus on:

Tracking Period Start/End Dates.

Logging Pad Usage (Type and Time).

Displaying History.

(Basic) Reminder to Change Pad.

Assumptions:

You have Flutter and Dart installed and set up.

You have a basic understanding of Flutter widgets and state management.

We'll use sqflite for local database storage and provider for simple state management, and flutter_local_notifications for reminders.
